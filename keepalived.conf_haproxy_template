   ! each load balancer should have a different ID
   ! this will be used in SMTP alerts, so you should make
   ! each router easily identifiable

! vrrp_sync_groups make sure that several router instances
! stay together on a failure - a good example of this is
! that the external interface on one router fails and the backup server
! takes over, you want the internal interface on the failed server
! to failover as well, otherwise nothing will work.
! you can have as many vrrp_sync_group blocks as you want.
vrrp_sync_group VG1 {
   group {
      VI_1
      VI_GATEWAY
   }
}

! each interface needs at least one vrrp_instance
! each vrrp_instance is a group of VIPs that are logically grouped
! together
! you can have as many vrrp_instaces as you want

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
        state MASTER
        interface ens3

    ! each virtual router id must be unique per instance name!
        virtual_router_id 51

    ! MASTER and BACKUP state are determined by the priority
    ! even if you specify MASTER as the state, the state will
    ! be voted on by priority (so if your state is MASTER but your
    ! priority is lower than the router with BACKUP, you will lose
    ! the MASTER state)
    ! I make it a habit to set priorities at least 50 points apart
    ! note that a lower number is lesser priority - lower gets less vote
        priority 150

    ! how often should we vote, in seconds?
        advert_int 1

    ! send an alert when this instance changes state from MASTER to BACKUP
        smtp_alert

    ! this authentication is for syncing between failover servers
    ! keepalived supports PASS, which is simple password
    ! authentication
    ! or AH, which is the IPSec authentication header.
    ! I don't use AH
    ! yet as many people have reported problems with it
        authentication {
                auth_type PASS
                auth_pass somepass
        }

    ! Unicast specific option, this is the IP of the interface keepalived listens on
    ! Unicast specific option, this is the IP of the peer instance 
    unicast_src_ip <this node IP>   
    unicast_peer {                
               <peer node IP>
        }
 

    ! these are the IP addresses that keepalived will setup on this
    ! machine. Later in the config we will specify which real
        ! servers  are behind these IPs
    ! without this block, keepalived will not setup and takedown the
    ! any IP addresses

        virtual_ipaddress {
                10.0.0.50
        ! and more if you want them
        }
}

! now I setup the instance that the real servers will use as a default
! gateway
! most of the config is the same as above, but on a different interface

vrrp_instance VI_GATEWAY {
        state MASTER
